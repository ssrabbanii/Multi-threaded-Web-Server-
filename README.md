# Multi-threaded-Web-Server-
Developed a multi-threaded Web server in Python that is capable of processing HTTP requests sent from browsers or some other client programs.

To run it, please follow the following steps in order.

(1) After extracting the file, open the project in a source-course editor.

(2) Then run the main.py file in the editor or through the terminal. Try running the server from the directory where your home page is located

(3) To open the client-side, type http://127.0.0.1:12000/  in your browser.

You will see the client-side. You can then use the client accordingly

The reason for using port 12000 is so that the browser doesn't try to connect to the default port 80.

You can also use the following valid URLs as well.
http://127.0.0.1:12000
http://127.0.0.1:12000/index.html
http://127.0.0.1:12000/image.png
http://127.0.0.1:12000/file.txt

(4) When you connect to the running web server with the browser, examine the message requests that the web server receives from the browser.
